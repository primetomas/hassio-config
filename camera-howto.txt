Good hints to get cmaera snapshots to work:
https://community.home-assistant.io/t/camera-snapshot-entity-id-in-filename/31697

My config in configuration.yaml
camera:
  - platform: ffmpeg
    input: /dev/video0
  - platform: ffmpeg
    input: /dev/video1
  - platform: local_file
    name: Cam1 pic
    file_path: /tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg.jpg
  - platform: local_file
    name: Cam2 pic
    file_path: /tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg_2.jpg


My config in groups.yaml
mycameras:
  name: Cameras
  view: no
  entities:
  - camera.ffmpeg
  - camera.ffmpeg_2
mypics:
  name: Pics
  view: no
  entities:
  - camera.local_file
  - camera.local_file_2

To make a snapshot, use the Services Developer tool and select Service "camera.snapshot", select the entity in the drop-down, and use some of the below JSON to make the snapshot.

{
"entity_id": "camera.ffmpeg_2",
"filename": "/tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg_2.jpg"
}

{
"entity_id": "camera.ffmpeg",
"filename": "/tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg.jpg"
}


Possible hint for making an actiona out of it, the goal to take a snapshot when there is motion for example.

action:
  service: camera.snapshot
  data:
    entity_id: camera.ffmpeg
    filename: '/tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg.png'
    
 - platform: local_file
    name: Logitech pic
    file_path: /tmp/snapshot_camera.ffmpeg.png
